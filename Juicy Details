🎯 Objective: Analyze logs from a breached juice shop system to identify attacker techniques, vulnerable endpoints, and stolen data. Practice reconnaissance and log analysis skills.
🛠️ Tools & Skills:

    Log file analysis (auth.log, vsftpd.log, access.log)

    Identifying brute-force and SQL injection attacks

    Correlating attacker activity across services

    Extracting indicators of compromise (IoCs)

📌 How I solved it:

    Downloaded and extracted the relevant log files.

    Identified attacker tools in order of appearance: nmap, hydra, sqlmap, curl, and feroxbuster.

    Found brute-force vulnerability at /rest/user/login endpoint.

    Found SQL injection vulnerability at /rest/products/search using parameter q.

    Confirmed attacker attempted file retrieval via FTP (vsftpd.log).

    Discovered attacker scraped user emails from the product reviews section.

    Verified brute-force attack success at timestamp [11/Apr/2021:09:16:31 +0000].

    Confirmed stolen user email and password data via SQL injection.

    Found attacker downloaded backup files: coupons_2013.md.bak and www-data.bak.

    Determined file retrieval used FTP service with username anonymous.

    Identified shell access gained through SSH with username www-data.

💡 Key Takeaways:

    Practiced comprehensive log analysis across multiple services.

    Improved skills in detecting brute-force and SQLi attacks.

    Learned to trace attacker behavior through endpoint and service logs.

    Enhanced ability to extract IoCs and understand attacker tactics.
