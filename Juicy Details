Juicy Details — TryHackMe

Overview:
This room focused on analyzing logs from a breached system to understand how an attacker gained access, what tools and techniques were used, and what data was stolen. I practiced basic research, reconnaissance, and log analysis.

Tasks Completed:

1️⃣ Reconnaissance:

    Downloaded and extracted auth.log, vsftpd.log, and access.log for analysis.

    Identified the attacker’s tools in order of occurrence: nmap, hydra, sqlmap, curl, and feroxbuster.

    Found the brute-force vulnerability at the endpoint: /rest/user/login.

    Found the SQL injection vulnerability at the endpoint: /rest/products/search.

    Determined the vulnerable parameter for SQL injection: q.

    Found that the attacker attempted to retrieve files using FTP (confirmed in vsftpd.log).

2️⃣ Stolen Data:

    Discovered the attacker scraped user email addresses via the product reviews section.

    Confirmed the brute-force attack succeeded — timestamp: 11/Apr/2021:09:16:31 +0000.

    Verified the attacker retrieved user email and password information through SQL injection.

    Found the attacker downloaded backup files: coupons_2013.md.bak and www-data.bak.

    Determined the service and account used to retrieve files: FTP, anonymous.

    Identified the attacker gained shell access using SSH with the www-data account.

Skills Practiced:

    Log analysis (cat, grep, less)

    Identifying brute-force and SQLi patterns in logs

    Endpoint vulnerability analysis

    Tracking attacker movement and data exfiltration

    Extracting indicators of compromise (IoCs)
